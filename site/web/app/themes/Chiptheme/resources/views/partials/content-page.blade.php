            <h2>WALNUT!</h2>
            <p>Walnuts are rounded, single-seeded stone fruits of the walnut tree commonly
             used for the meat after fully ripening. 
             Following full ripening, the removal of the husk reveals the wrinkly walnut shell, 
             which is usually commercially found in two segments (three-segment 
             shells can also form). During the ripening process, 
             the husk will become brittle and the shell hard.</p>
